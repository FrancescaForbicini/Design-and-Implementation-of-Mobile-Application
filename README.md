## How does it work?

SpotifyMusicQuiz is an interactive quiz app based on the musical tastes of a user.
The app asks the user to log in with Spotify (leveraging the Spotify API), understand their favorite
tracks and artists, and start an infinite quiz of questions based on them.
Examples of the questions could be “In which year was album X released”, “What’s the most listened song
of album X”, “Who wrote song X”, etc.
Some of the questions use the 30s preview feature of Spotify API to ask the user to guess the
song.
It is present also a leaderboard of user scores based on a global rank or on a local rank.
